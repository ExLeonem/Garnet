## Available Scripts

For a list of all commands check out the package.json. As this project is a react application, you should theoretically be able to use all scripts useable on initialization of a react applciation.

Following scripts can be run in the project directory for sure.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.**\***<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**\*** The complete project setup needs to be performed beforehand and the containers need to run, else the frontend application won't be able to pull information from the database and routing engine.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
